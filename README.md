Data logging to SD card
=======================

I am wanting to log this data to an SD card so it can be reviewed
later after the flight.  This data will be logged to an SD card.





Required Libraries - these are the libraries that I used.

This is the library for the Gyro -
https://github.com/pololu/l3g4200d-arduino

This is the library for the Barometric pressure sensor -
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library

I was able to install the BMP085 library thorugh the new Arduino
1.6.4 library manager.
