GY80
====

Arduino/Processing sketch for GY80 9DOF AHRS


Required Libraries - these are the libraries that I used.

This is the library for the Gyro - https://github.com/pololu/l3g4200d-arduino
This is the library for the Barometric pressure sensor - https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library

I was able to install the BMP085 library thorugh the new Arduino 1.6.4 library manager.
